8. JavaScript DOM manipulation
8.1 - Relationship between JavaScript and HTML: why do we need JS?
       ---web-page Revesion----
  --HTML--is a set of specifications to describe the elements of your page.
    --??
  --CSS---is set of rules to tell browser how to display those elements.
    --??
  --JavaScript--is the only programming language of the three. That is used to dynamically change the behavior, display and interactions of a page.
    --??
    https://www.apple.com
     request sent--how request sent?
     --network --ip address(192.168.10.1)?
       ---request
           --reponse--html--
              ---html rendrer-- which contructs your html in to this viewable format on your browser.
                ---also-css--
              ---css rendrer-- which contructs your css in to this viewable format on your browser.

        may be you sent javascript to your browser
               ---request-- is sent
                  --html&css have thier own rendrer
                  --browser have interpretor
                  ---computer have compiler
                  -javascript-its pro langu which is used to give instruction to change html and css Properties 
                  ---background color or others

                why we need javascript ?

                --example -- evangadi userlogin form
                           --intractivity of userlogin from
                           imagination plus intractivity with customer
    
8.2 - How do we add JS into our HTML?
      --1-- frst way
    ---user script tag 
        <script>

        </script>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    --may be you use it at head tag--
    --may be you use it at the begin of body tag--
    --may be you use it at the bottom of body tag--
    ===IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED WAY----?
       
       --2-- second way

       <script type="text/javascript" src="js/javascript.js"></script>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        --may be you use it at head tag--
         <script type="text/javascript" src="js/javascript.js"></script>
         =the aim of js is to manipulate the html elements during this one thing is happen
           what is that--our browser renders this html line by line when it looks this script tag at head of the html it finds the script tag which is not a part of html part during this our javascript facing with error b/cs it is not a part of
            element---to avoid this ?
        --may be you use it at the bottom of body tag--
       ---use script tag at bottom
        <script type="text/javascript" src="js/javascript.js"></script>
                    ----------or proper way-----------
        --may be you use it at head tag--
        <script type="text/javascript" src="js/javascript.js"defer></script>
         defer-- means include it at the last
    8.3 - Understanding DOM: how do HTML and JS work together?
            DOM--Document Object Model
            DOM--connector of HTML and JS
            DOM--means-it is a standard/rule which is respected by browser and javascript
            DOM--it is a standard/rule  which agree browser and javascript to cowork togather
            ---browser--follow DOM Rule and do its activity
            ---javascript--follow DOM Rule and do its activity
            ##now how we use DOM to affect our webpage/website##
            DOM---it is a rule which every language depends on it and write code usig any language then browser have responsibility to implement and understand that code.
           
            ---so now the javascript is a language which respects the DOM rule-----
var abebe={
    pr1:1;
    pr2:2;
}
abebe.pr1=55;

 DOM ---when you went to change your vlue can prepare for you like this and renders the DOM 
       again and construct your webpage again and redisplay again
       https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp

var document={
    html:{
        head:{
            title:{
                value:"document"
            }
        }
    }
}
html.head.title.value="abebe"

8.4 - The DOM tree

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title> the title</title>
</head>

<body>
    <script>

    </script>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/javascript.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp
var document={
    html:{
        head:{
            title:{
                value:"title"
            }
        }
    }
}
html.head.title.value="abebe"

8.5 - DOM manipulation: introduction
---use js to affect the Properties of css and html and cause effect on our browser is called DOM Manupulation.
---use js,DOM when your user wents to make a change on the DOM to aknowledage the answer for the customer to intract with user.
---manipulate=-to make something to change something smously. 
Manupulating DOM involves two steeps
--1- finding/selecting the element we went to work with
--2- altering the next or attributies of the element
var document={
    html:{
        head:{
            title:{
                value:"title"
            }
        }
    }
}
html.head.title.value="abebe"
==we manupulate via this document word as an enterance pathway to apply each and every html and css properties.
8.6 - DOM manipulation: selecting elements (part 1)
--slecting elements on html using javascript
-----selection  type------
--single element selection
--mulitiple selection
-------------------------------
indivisual element selection
-----=there are three common ways to select a specific elements---===
==1== using the getElementById() Method
EX--
==2==using the queryselector()method
Ex--
==3==By traversing from one element to the next 
 will see example later
8.7 - DOM manipulation: selecting elements (part 2)
-if you went to select one element only
      Use-- getElementQueryselector()
           it seslect only one elements even the properties we inludes many elements
             --document.queryselector(."yellow")
             --document.queryselector(li)

             ==so Here we use qquery selector and getElementById
             to select single element

     =====================
     how we manipulate or affect our selected element

     ==Mulitiple selector
     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     how we affect mulitiple selector
     1-document.getElementclassName()
     2-Document.getElementByTagName()
     3-
      

8.8 - Selecting elements (HTML collection vs NodeList )

//live Dom--? Immidatly online on the value.
$$$-getElementsByClassName---return live dom collection Object--so w can not able to see them in this case we have to save them on temporary array we loop on them.
$$$-getElementsByTagName---does mot return live dom collections--so we have do for loop to display elements
$$$-getElementsByquweryselectorAll---does mot return live dom collections--so we have do for loop to display elements
Accesing by Referance
    Aceesing BY Refrance 
    Accesing By Value

8.9 - Selecting elements (traversing between multiple elements)
== now we are focusing on the nighbouring elements to affect the srounding elements
==we can traversing from one element to another by using the following properties==
1-parseMode
2-previouseElementSibling
3-nextElementSibling
4-firstElementChild
5-lastElementChild
8.10 - Altering values (working with HTML content)
up to now we only change classname===but now we can change any thing using our javascript
---how we change ang text---
use textcontent 
---how i can create new paragrap using javascript---
     createElement()---textcontent
apendchild()--to add a new element to somewhere as a new element


8.11 - Altering values (working with HTML attribute)
you have the following properties methods you are request to altering
--classname()
--classlist()---
--id()
----------------------
--hasAttribute()
--getAttribute()
--setAttribute()
--removeAttribute()

8.12 - Altering values (working with inline styling)
